This is an example of high-order functions in python

In mathematics and computer science, a higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:

1. takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. procedural parameters),
2. returns a function as its result.

This demo includes the following functions:
1. map and reduce
2. filter
3. sorted
